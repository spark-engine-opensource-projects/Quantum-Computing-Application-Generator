## Overview

The **Quantum Problem Solver** is an innovative tool built with **Next.js**, designed to assist users in defining quantum computing problems and automatically generating quantum circuit designs using the **Spark Engine API**. The application is equipped with a dynamic user interface and backend integration that allows for seamless deployment to Vercel, making it highly scalable and efficient for real-world quantum problem-solving.

## Features

- **Define Quantum Problems**: Choose from various quantum computing problem types (e.g., Optimization, Cryptography, Quantum Simulation) and customize objectives and application details.
- **Quantum Circuit Generation**: Automatically generate quantum circuit designs via the **Spark API** and display them in an interactive, structured format.
- **Dynamic UI**: Features an intuitive user interface with responsive components, collapsible sections, and loading indicators for real-time feedback.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Quantum Problem Solver, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **Next.js** (v12.x or higher)
- An account with [Spark Engine](https://sparkengine.ai) to obtain your Spark API key.
- A **Vercel account** for deploying the app (required for serverless API functions).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spark-engine-opensource-projects/quantum-computing-application-generator
   cd quantum-computing-application-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   You'll need to configure your Spark API key for the application. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add the following:

   ```bash
   SPARK_API_KEY=your-spark-api-key
   ```

## Usage

### Defining Quantum Problems

1. Start the application by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Use the form to define your quantum computing problem, specifying problem types, subtypes, and objectives. The app will dynamically generate a quantum circuit based on the provided details.

3. The circuit design will be displayed, allowing you to review and further refine the problem or circuit as needed.

### API Usage

The app interacts with the **Spark API** to generate quantum circuits. The function `callSpark` in the `utils/spark.js` handles the communication between the app and the API. It sends the defined quantum problem data and processes the returned circuit information for display.

## Project Structure

- **`components/DefineProblem.js`**: Handles the user input for defining quantum problems (problem type, objectives, and more).
- **`components/QuantumCircuitDesign.js`**: Displays the quantum circuit design generated by the Spark API.
- **`pages/index.js`**: The main page that combines the problem definition and circuit design components.
- **`utils/spark.js`**: Contains the `callSpark` function, responsible for making API calls to SparkEngine.
- **`pages/api/callSpark.js`**: A serverless function that handles API requests from the frontend.

## Deployment Workflow

### Deploying to Vercel

This application requires deployment to Vercel to fully utilize the serverless API functions.

1. **Push the Project to GitHub**:

   Ensure the project is connected to a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. **Connect to Vercel**:

   Sign in to your Vercel account, connect the repository, and configure your **Spark API key** in the Vercel environment variables settings.

   ```bash
   SPARK_API_KEY=your-spark-api-key
   ```

3. **Deploy the Application**:

   Follow Vercelâ€™s steps to deploy your project. Once deployed, the app will be live, and all serverless API routes will be functional.

## Error Handling

The app includes basic error handling, particularly for API calls. If the Spark API fails after three retries, a descriptive error message is displayed to the user.

### Retry Logic

If the Spark API call fails, the app attempts to retry up to three times before giving up and showing an error notification.

## Customization

You can extend or modify the app to fit additional requirements. For example:

- **Adding New Problem Types**: Update `DefineProblem.js` to include more quantum problem types or objectives.
- **UI Enhancements**: Adjust the styling and layout in the `components/` folder to create custom user experiences.
